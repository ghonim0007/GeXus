**GeXus** is an open-source framework designed to tackle the challenges of big geospatial data. The aim is to bridge the gap between traditional GIS data formats and modern big data processing pipelines.

## The Vision

A comprehensive set of tools is being built for processing, analyzing, and integrating geospatial data at scale. GeXus will provide a central hub for connecting diverse data sources to powerful analytics engines like Apache Beam, enabling users to:

  * Ingest various geospatial data formats (e.g., FlatGeobuf, GeoTIFF) efficiently.
  * Perform complex spatial analysis on massive datasets.
  * Integrate seamlessly with modern data warehouses like BigQuery.

## Current Status

This project is in its initial development phase. The core components are currently being built, starting with native support for the **FlatGeobuf** format.
